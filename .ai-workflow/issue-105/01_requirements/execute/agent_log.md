## Turn 4: AI応答

I've successfully created a comprehensive requirements document for Issue #105. Here's a summary of what was delivered:

## Key Highlights:

### 📋 **Complete Requirements Coverage**
1. **6 Functional Requirements (FR-1 to FR-6)**:
   - FR-1: Jest configuration extension for ESM packages (High priority, blocker)
   - FR-2: Making commit-manager.test.ts integration tests executable (High priority, blocker)
   - FR-3: Fixing high-priority tests (High priority, blocker)
   - FR-4: Conditional experimental-vm-modules adoption (Medium priority, optional)
   - FR-5: CLAUDE.md updates (Medium priority)
   - FR-6: CHANGELOG.md updates (Medium priority)

2. **6 Acceptance Criteria (AC-1 to AC-6)** in Given-When-Then format:
   - All testable and measurable
   - Directly mapped to functional requirements
   - Clear success conditions

### 🎯 **Quality Gates Compliance**
✅ All 4 mandatory quality gates satisfied:
- Functional requirements clearly documented
- Acceptance criteria defined with Given-When-Then
- Scope clearly defined (in-scope vs out-of-scope)
- No logical contradictions

### 📊 **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **NFR-1**: Performance (test execution time ≤ 2-3 min)
- **NFR-2**: Security (no new dependencies, no secrets in test code)
- **NFR-3**: Availability/Reliability (regression tests pass, 90%+ coverage maintained)
- **NFR-4**: Maintainability (no src/ changes, rollback capability)

### 🔒 **Constraints & Scope Management**
- **Technical constraints**: Jest + ts-jest ecosystem, chalk v5.3.0 (ESM only), Node.js 20+
- **Resource constraints**: 4-6 hours total, no src/ code changes
- **Out of scope**: Fixing all 103 tests (only high-priority blockers), chalk v4.x migration, test runner migration

### 🎨 **Structure & Quality**
- Follows the required 8-section structure (0-7)
- Integrates Planning Document insights
- Specific, measurable, verifiable requirements (no vague statements)
- Comprehensive coverage of Issue #102 evaluation report findings

The document is ready for Phase 2 (Design) and provides a solid foundation for successful implementation! 🚀
