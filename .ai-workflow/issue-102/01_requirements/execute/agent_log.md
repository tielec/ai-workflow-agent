## Turn 2: AI応答

I'll analyze the planning document and create a detailed requirements specification for Issue #102.

## Turn 3: ツール使用

**ツール**: `Read`

**パラメータ**:
- `file_path`: `/tmp/jenkins-a61a4102/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator_develop/.ai-workflow/issue-52/0...`

## Turn 4: AI応答

Now I'll create a detailed requirements specification document based on the planning document and evaluation report.

## Turn 5: ツール使用

**ツール**: `Write`

**パラメータ**:
- `file_path`: `/tmp/jenkins-a61a4102/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator_develop/.ai-workflow/issue-102/...`
- `content`: `# 要件定義書 - Issue #102

## 0. Planning Documentの確認

Planning Documentを確認し、以下の開発計画を踏まえて要件定義を実施しました：

##...`

## Turn 6: AI応答

Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive requirements specification document for Issue #102. Here's a summary of what was delivered:

## 📋 Requirements Specification Created

### Document Structure (11 Sections)

**Section 0: Planning Document Review**
- Confirmed development plan from Planning Phase
- Strategy: EXTEND (test file modifications only)
- Estimated effort: 2-3 hours
- Risk: Low

**Section 1: Overview**
- Background: Follow-up tasks from Issue #52 evaluation
- Purpose: Fix test expectations and Jest configuration
- Business & Technical Value clearly defined

**Section 2: Functional Requirements (4 Requirements)**
- **FR-1**: Fix file-selector.test.ts expectations (lines 72-79)
- **FR-2**: Fix commit-message-builder.test.ts expectations (lines 205, 222)
- **FR-3**: Update jest.config.cjs for chalk ESM support
- **FR-4**: Regression testing after all fixes

**Section 3: Non-Functional Requirements**
- Performance, Maintainability, Reliability, Extensibility

**Section 4: Constraints**
- Technical, Resource, Policy constraints clearly defined

**Section 5: Prerequisites**
- System environment, Dependencies, External integrations

**Section 6: Acceptance Criteria (5 Criteria)**
- All in Given-When-Then format
- AC-1 through AC-5 with specific verification steps

**Section 7: Out of Scope**
- Source code (src/) modifications excluded
- New test case additions excluded
- Future enhancement candidates listed

**Section 8: Quality Gates**
✅ All 4 mandatory quality gates met:
- Clear functional requirements
- Defined acceptance criteria
- Clear scope boundaries
- No logical contradictions

**Section 9: Risk Assessment**
- Detailed mitigation strategies for all 4 risks from Planning

**Section 10: Dependencies & References**
- Links to Issue #52, evaluation report, planning document
- Target files clearly identified

**Section 11: Success Criteria**
- 5 specific success criteria defined

### Key Highlights

✅ **Specific & Measurable**: All requirements are concrete with clear verification methods

✅ **Complete**: All information from Issue #102 and Planning Document reflected

✅ **Testable**: Every requirement has corresponding acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format

✅ **No Ambiguity**: Avoided vague expressions like "appropriately handle" or "as needed"

✅ **Consistent**: No contradictions between sections (functional requirements ↔ acceptance criteria, NFRs ↔ constraints)

✅ **Review-Ready**: Designed to pass critical thinking review with all quality gates met

The requirements specification is now ready for the review phase!
