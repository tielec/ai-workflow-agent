## Turn 2: AI応答

I'll create a comprehensive requirements document based on the GitHub Issue #58 and the planning document. Let me analyze the information provided and create a detailed requirements specification.

## Turn 3: ツール使用

**ツール**: `Write`

**パラメータ**:
- `file_path`: `/tmp/jenkins-983471c5/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator_develop/.ai-workflow/issue-58/0...`
- `content`: `# 要件定義書 - Issue #58

## 0. Planning Documentの確認

Planning Phase（`.ai-workflow/issue-58/00_planning/o...`

## Turn 4: AI応答

I've created a comprehensive requirements document for Issue #58. Here's a summary of what I've delivered:

## Requirements Document Overview

### Key Highlights:

1. **Planning Document Integration** (Section 0)
   - Confirmed development strategy: EXTEND (minor improvements to existing implementation)
   - Test strategy: UNIT_INTEGRATION
   - Complexity: Simple, 4-8 hours estimated effort
   - Risk: Low

2. **Functional Requirements** (Section 2)
   - **FR-1**: Regex pattern improvement in `sanitizeGitUrl()` to handle passwords with `@` symbol
   - **FR-2**: Monitoring script to analyze token detection frequency over 2 weeks
   - **FR-3**: Migration command (`ai-workflow migrate --sanitize-tokens`) to automatically sanitize tokens in existing metadata files

3. **Non-Functional Requirements** (Section 3)
   - Performance: ReDoS vulnerability assessment, efficient file I/O
   - Security: Path traversal prevention, symlink attack prevention, token masking
   - Reliability: Zero impact on production (Defense in Depth pattern already in place)
   - Maintainability: No new dependencies, TypeScript standard library only

4. **Acceptance Criteria** (Section 6)
   - **AC-1**: 6 criteria for regex pattern improvement (pattern change, comment update, test fixes, all tests pass, regression tests pass, no ReDoS vulnerability)
   - **AC-2**: 8 criteria for monitoring script (script creation, log parsing, statistics collection, report generation, token masking, error handling)
   - **AC-3**: 15 criteria for migration command (CLI integration, metadata file discovery, token detection, sanitization, backup creation, dry-run mode, security measures, unit tests, integration tests, 90%+ coverage)
   - **AC-4**: 5 overall criteria (TypeScript compilation, ESLint check, all tests pass, documentation update, regression tests)

5. **Out of Scope** (Section 7)
   - Auto-migration during workflow initialization
   - Automatic notifications (Slack/Email)
   - Detection of other credential types (OAuth, SSH keys)
   - UI/UX enhancements (progress bars, colors)

6. **Future Extensions** (Section 8)
   - Backup versioning and auto-cleanup
   - Rollback functionality
   - Dashboard visualization
   - Generic secret detection framework

### Quality Gates Met:

✅ **Functional requirements clearly documented** - All 3 tasks from Issue #54 evaluation are covered
✅ **Acceptance criteria defined** - 34 testable criteria using Given-When-Then format
✅ **Scope is clear** - 7 out-of-scope items and 6 future extensions explicitly listed
✅ **No logical contradictions** - Aligned with Planning Document and Issue #54 evaluation

The document is ready for critical thinking review. All requirements are specific, measurable, and testable.
