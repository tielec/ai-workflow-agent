## Turn 1: システム初期化

**セッションID**: `61fee786-8667-4f7a-a359-35d99713f589`
**モデル**: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
**権限モード**: bypassPermissions
**利用可能ツール**: Task, Bash, Glob, Grep, ExitPlanMode, Read, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, BashOutput, KillShell, Skill, SlashCommand

## Turn 2: AI応答

I'll create a detailed requirements document for Issue #108 based on the planning document and issue information.

## Turn 3: ツール使用

**ツール**: `Write`

**パラメータ**:
- `file_path`: `/tmp/jenkins-e944c699/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator_develop/.ai-workflow/issue-108/...`
- `content`: `# 要件定義書 - Issue #108

## 0. Planning Document の確認

Planning Document（`@.ai-workflow/issue-108/00_pla...`

## Turn 4: AI応答

I've created a comprehensive requirements document for Issue #108. Here's a summary of what I've included:

## Key Highlights:

### 0. Planning Document Review
- Confirmed the development strategy: EXTEND (existing file modifications only)
- Test strategy: UNIT_ONLY (27 test cases)
- Estimated effort: 2-3 hours
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies

### 1. Overview
- **Background**: 3 remaining tasks from Issue #104's Evaluation Phase
- **Purpose**: Improve test quality, code quality, and workflow improvement foundation
- **Business Value**: Enhanced reliability, maintainability, and transparency
- **Technical Value**: 100% test pass rate, code consistency, workflow improvement insights

### 2. Functional Requirements (3 Requirements)

**FR-1: Fix Test Expectations (Priority: Medium)**
- Fix 4 test cases (2.1.1, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.2.4) to comply with design specs (20-char/80-char limits)
- Success: All 27 test cases PASS, code readability maintained

**FR-2: Optional trim() Implementation (Priority: Low)**
- Add `.trim()` to `extractKeywords()` method in `issue-client.ts`
- Decision based on trade-off analysis in Phase 2
- Success: No impact to existing 27 test cases

**FR-3: Phase 9 Prompt Improvement Investigation (Priority: Low)**
- Review Evaluation Phase prompt for `blockerStatus`/`deferredReason` extraction
- Investigation only; implementation deferred to Issue #109
- Success: Sufficient information collected for Issue #109 creation

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Test execution < 30 seconds, Git operations < 10 seconds each
- **Security**: 0 ESLint/TypeScript errors, no secrets in test data
- **Reliability**: 100% test pass rate, rollback capability
- **Maintainability**: Clear test intent, detailed implementation logs

### 4. Constraints
- **Technical**: No new files, no type definition changes, no architecture changes
- **Resource**: 2-3 hours total, max 30 minutes in Jenkins
- **Policy**: Follow CLAUDE.md/ARCHITECTURE.md coding standards (logger usage, config access, error handling)

### 5. Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+, npm 10+, TypeScript 5.x, Jest 29.x
- Issue #104 completed with Evaluation Report
- GitHub API access, Git remote configured
- AI agent (Codex or Claude)

### 6. Acceptance Criteria (6 Criteria)

**AC-1**: Test expectations fixed (Given-When-Then format)
**AC-2**: trim() trade-off analysis completed
**AC-3**: Phase 9 prompt investigation completed
**AC-4**: Issue #104 Evaluation Report updated
**AC-5**: All unit tests (27/27) PASS
**AC-6**: Documentation completed (implementation logs, investigation results)

### 7. Out of Scope
- Phase 9 prompt improvement implementation (deferred to Issue #109)
- New test case additions (27 cases sufficient)
- Type definition changes
- Architecture changes
- Other test file modifications

### Future Expansion Candidates
- Issue #109: Phase 9 prompt improvement implementation
- LLM-based title generation for follow-up issues
- Flexible keyword extraction beyond 20-char limit

## Quality Gates Compliance:

✅ **Functional requirements clearly documented** (FR-1, FR-2, FR-3)
✅ **Acceptance criteria defined** (AC-1 through AC-6 in Given-When-Then format)
✅ **Scope clearly defined** (Section 7 with explicit out-of-scope items)
✅ **No logical contradictions** (Aligned with Planning Document, consistent across sections)

The requirements document is ready for the critical thinking review phase.
