## Turn 2: AI応答

I'll analyze the planning document and project documentation to create a comprehensive requirements specification for Issue #23.

## Turn 3: ツール使用

**ツール**: `Read`

**パラメータ**:
- `file_path`: `/tmp/jenkins-7da50bdc/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator/src/phases/base-phase.ts`

## Turn 4: AI応答

Now I'll create a comprehensive requirements document based on the planning document and code analysis:

## Turn 5: ツール使用

**ツール**: `Write`

**パラメータ**:
- `file_path`: `/tmp/jenkins-7da50bdc/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator/.ai-workflow/issue-23/01_requir...`
- `content`: `# 要件定義書 - Issue #23: BasePhase アーキテクチャの分割

## 0. Planning Document の確認

## Turn 6: AI応答

I've successfully created a comprehensive requirements specification for Issue #23. Here's what I've delivered:

## Summary of Requirements Document

### Key Highlights:

1. **Planning Document Integration** (Section 0)
   - Confirmed the development plan from Planning Phase
   - Identified key risks and mitigation strategies
   - Estimated effort: 20-28 hours

2. **Functional Requirements** (Section 2)
   - **FR-1**: LogFormatter module (300-400 lines)
   - **FR-2**: ProgressFormatter module (200-250 lines)
   - **FR-3**: AgentExecutor module (200-250 lines)
   - **FR-4**: ReviewCycleManager module (150-200 lines)
   - **FR-5**: BasePhase refactoring (reduce to ≤300 lines)
   - **FR-6**: Minimize impact on existing phase classes

3. **Non-Functional Requirements** (Section 3)
   - Performance: ±10% of current execution time
   - Security: Maintain current security level
   - Reliability: 100% integration test pass rate
   - Maintainability: SRP compliance, 80%+ test coverage

4. **Acceptance Criteria** (Section 6)
   - 10 detailed acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format
   - Covers all modules, testing, documentation, and regression testing

5. **Quality Gates**
   - ✅ **Functional requirements clearly defined** (6 main requirements with detailed sub-requirements)
   - ✅ **Acceptance criteria defined** (10 comprehensive criteria)
   - ✅ **Scope clearly defined** (Section 7: Scope exclusions and future enhancements)
   - ✅ **No logical contradictions** (Requirements are consistent and aligned with planning document)

### Key Strengths:

- **Specificity**: All requirements are measurable (e.g., "300 lines or less", "80%+ coverage", "3 retries max")
- **Consistency**: Aligned with Planning Phase strategy (REFACTOR, UNIT_INTEGRATION testing)
- **Completeness**: All aspects from Issue #23 are covered
- **Verifiability**: Each requirement has testable acceptance criteria
- **Traceability**: Clear mapping from Planning → Requirements → Design

The requirements document is ready for critical thinking review and will serve as the foundation for the Design Phase (Phase 2).
