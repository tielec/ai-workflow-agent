## Turn 2: AI応答

I'll create a detailed requirements definition document based on the GitHub Issue #2 and the planning document. Let me analyze the information and create a comprehensive requirements document.

## Turn 3: ツール使用

**ツール**: `Write`

**パラメータ**:
- `file_path`: `/tmp/jenkins-9132b5d3/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator/.ai-workflow/issue-2/01_require...`
- `content`: `# 要件定義書 - Issue #2

## 0. Planning Document の確認

Planning Phase で策定された開発計画を確認しました：

- **実装戦略**: EXTE...`

## Turn 4: AI応答

I've successfully created a comprehensive requirements definition document for Issue #2. Here's a summary of what was included:

## 📋 Requirements Document Overview

### Key Sections:

1. **Planning Document Review** - Confirmed the implementation strategy (EXTEND), test strategy (UNIT_INTEGRATION), and risk assessment from Phase 0

2. **Overview** - Clearly defined the background, purpose, business value, and technical value of the cleanup feature

3. **Functional Requirements (FR-1 to FR-7)**:
   - CLI option additions (`--cleanup-on-complete`, `--cleanup-on-complete-force`)
   - Cleanup method implementation
   - Confirmation prompt for interactive environments
   - Git commit & push automation
   - Error handling strategy
   - Integration with Evaluation Phase
   - Logging requirements

4. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-1 to NFR-6)**:
   - Performance (< 5 seconds for typical directories)
   - Reliability (workflow continues even if cleanup fails)
   - Maintainability (follows Report Phase patterns)
   - Extensibility (designed for future enhancements)
   - Security (path validation, symlink protection)
   - Usability (clear warning messages)

5. **Constraints** - Technical, resource, and policy constraints clearly defined

6. **Prerequisites** - System environment, dependencies, and external integrations documented

7. **Acceptance Criteria (AC-1 to AC-10)** - All scenarios written in Given-When-Then format:
   - CLI option behavior
   - Default behavior (no cleanup)
   - Confirmation prompts (interactive vs CI environments)
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Git operations
   - Log output verification

8. **Out of Scope** - Clearly identified features for future enhancement

### Quality Gates Status:
✅ **All 4 quality gates met**:
- ✅ Functional requirements clearly documented
- ✅ Acceptance criteria defined (10 scenarios in Given-When-Then format)
- ✅ Scope clearly defined (in-scope and out-of-scope)
- ✅ No logical contradictions

The document is ready for the critical thinking review phase and subsequent design phase (Phase 2).
