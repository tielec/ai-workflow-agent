## Turn 2: AI応答

I'll create a detailed requirements document based on the planning document and GitHub Issue #64. Let me analyze the information and produce a comprehensive requirements specification.

## Turn 3: ツール使用

**ツール**: `Write`

**パラメータ**:
- `file_path`: `/tmp/jenkins-d19db687/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator_develop/.ai-workflow/issue-64/0...`
- `content`: `# 要件定義書 - Issue #64

**Issue**: [FOLLOW-UP] Issue #61 - 残タスク
**プロジェクト**: ai-workflow-agent
**作成日**: ...`

## Turn 4: AI応答

I've successfully created a comprehensive requirements document for Issue #64. Here's a summary of what was produced:

## Requirements Document Summary

### Key Sections:

1. **Planning Document Review** - Confirmed the EXTEND strategy, UNIT_ONLY testing, and 3-5 hour estimate from Phase 0

2. **Overview** - Clear background explaining this is follow-up work from Issue #61, with 4 remaining tasks

3. **Functional Requirements (FR-1 to FR-4)**:
   - **FR-1**: Delete ~30 .ts.bak files (Priority: High)
   - **FR-2**: Improve coloring tests to work in CI (Priority: Low)
   - **FR-3**: Replace 45 console calls in 13 test files with unified logger (Priority: Low)
   - **FR-4**: Add LOG_NO_COLOR=true to Jenkinsfile (Priority: Low)

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Performance (no impact expected)
   - Security (prevent accidental deletions)
   - Reliability (rollback capability)
   - Maintainability (ESLint compliance, documentation)

5. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - **5 Mandatory Criteria** (blockers for merge):
     - All .ts.bak files deleted
     - Build succeeds
     - ESLint errors = 0
     - All 24 logger tests pass in CI
     - No regressions in existing tests
   - **3 Recommended Criteria** (quality improvements):
     - Console calls replaced
     - CI environment variable set
     - Documentation updated

6. **Out of Scope** - Clearly defined what's NOT included (logger enhancements, coverage improvements, CI/CD pipeline changes, new features)

### Quality Gate Compliance:

✅ **Functional requirements clearly defined** - All 4 tasks documented with detailed specifications
✅ **Acceptance criteria defined** - Given-When-Then format for all requirements
✅ **Scope is clear** - Both in-scope and out-of-scope items explicitly listed
✅ **No logical contradictions** - Requirements align with Planning Document strategy

The document is ready for Phase 2 (Design) and provides a solid foundation with specific, measurable, and testable requirements.
