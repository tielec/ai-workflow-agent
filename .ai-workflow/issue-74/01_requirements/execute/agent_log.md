## Turn 6: AI応答

Perfect! I have successfully created a comprehensive requirements document for Issue #74. Here's a summary of what was created:

## Requirements Document Summary

### Key Sections Created:

1. **Planning Document Confirmation** - Validated the development strategy (EXTEND, UNIT_ONLY, EXTEND_TEST)

2. **Overview** - Clear background, objectives, and business/technical value

3. **Functional Requirements (FR-1 to FR-4)**:
   - FR-1: Fix test case 2.6.5 environment dependency (HIGH priority)
   - FR-2: Fix test case 2.6.6 environment dependency (HIGH priority)
   - FR-3: Evaluate ESLint rule addition (LOW priority)
   - FR-4: Evaluate SecretMasker integration (LOW priority)

4. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-1 to NFR-4)**:
   - Performance, reliability, maintainability, and documentation quality requirements

5. **Constraints** - Technical, resource, and policy constraints clearly defined

6. **Prerequisites** - System environment, dependencies, and external systems

7. **Acceptance Criteria (AC-1 to AC-8)** - All written in Given-When-Then format:
   - AC-1: Test case 2.6.5 fixed
   - AC-2: Test case 2.6.6 fixed
   - AC-3: Proper environment variable deletion/restoration
   - AC-4: 100% test suite success rate
   - AC-5: ESLint rule evaluation completed
   - AC-6: SecretMasker integration evaluation completed
   - AC-7: Documentation updated (if needed)
   - AC-8: No regression

8. **Out of Scope** - Clear definition of what's not included and future extension candidates

9. **Success Criteria** - 4 clear success criteria aligned with Planning Document

10. **Risks and Mitigation** - 4 risks identified with mitigation strategies

### Quality Gates Met ✅:
1. ✅ **Functional requirements clearly documented** - 4 requirements (FR-1 to FR-4)
2. ✅ **Acceptance criteria defined** - 8 criteria (AC-1 to AC-8) in Given-When-Then format
3. ✅ **Scope is clear** - Section 7 clearly defines out-of-scope items
4. ✅ **No logical contradictions** - All sections are consistent and aligned

The requirements document is ready for the critical thinking review phase!
