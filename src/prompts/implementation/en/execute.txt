# Implementation Phase - Execution Prompt

**IMPORTANT: Write all document content in English. All sections, descriptions, and explanations must be in English.**

## Task Summary
Perform the actual code implementation based on the design document and test scenario.

## Input Information

### Planning Phase Deliverables
- Planning Document: {planning_document_path}

**Note**: If the Planning Phase is being performed, be sure to review the development plan (implementation strategy, testing strategy, risks, schedule).

### Design document (if available)
{design_context}
<!--
If present: Reference to @design.md
If not present: "No design document available. Please make appropriate design decisions based on issue and planning information."
-->

### Test scenario (if available)
{test_scenario_context}
<!--
If present: Reference to @test-scenario.md
If not present: "Test scenario not available. Please take appropriate testing considerations into implementation."
-->

### Requirements document (if available)
{requirements_context}
<!--
If present: Reference to @requirements.md
If not present: "Requirements document not available. Infer requirements from Planning and Issue information."
-->

### Implementation strategy (Phase
**{implementation_strategy}**

## Response by implementation strategy

Phase Perform appropriate implementation according to the implementation strategy determined in 2:

### CREATE (new)
- Create a new file
- Minimize the impact on existing files
-

### Follow the design document's "new file list"

### EXTEND
- Read and understand existing files
- Extend to match the existing coding style
- Follow the design document's "modification file list"

### REFACTOR
- Improve the structure of existing code
- Improve quality while maintaining functionality
- If the test already exists, make sure the test passes

## Implementation steps

### 1. Understanding the existing code

Check the "List of changed/added files" written in the design document and read the related files.

**Files to be read**:
- Existing files described in the design document
- Related documents (README, CONTRIBUTION, etc.)
- Existing test files (if any)

### 2. Check coding standards
Check the project's coding conventions:
- @CONTRIBUTION.md (if available)
- @CLAUDE.md (if available)
- Style of existing code

### 3. Execute the implementation

Follow the design document and implement the following:

#### 3.1 Code Implementation
- Follow the Detailed Design section of the design document
- Implement functions/classes/methods
- Add appropriate error handling
- Write comments/documentation strings

#### 3.2 Test code implementation (move to Phase 5)

**In Phase 4, only the actual code (business logic, API, data model, etc.) will be implemented, and the test code will be implemented in Phase 5 (test_implementation). **

It references test scenarios created in Phase 3, but does not implement the test code itself.

#### 3.3 File Operations
Use the following tools to manipulate files:
- **Read**: Read a file
- **Write**: Create a new file
- **Edit**: Edit an existing file

### 4. Record implementation log

Please record the implemented contents in the following format:

```markdown
# Implementation completion report

## List of changed files

| File | Change type | Summary |
|---------|---------|------|
| `path/to/file.py` | New/Modified/Deleted | Describe the summary in one sentence |

## Major Changes

Please briefly describe the important changes in 3-5 bullet points (1-2 sentences each):
- (Change 1)
- (Change 2)
- (Change 3)

## Testing status
- Build: ✅ Success / ❌ Failure
- Lint: ✅ Success / ❌ Failure
- Basic operation check: (concisely stated)
```

Please save this log as `.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/04_implementation/output/implementation.md`.

## Quality Gates (Phase 4)

Implementations must meet the following quality gates:

- [ ] **Implementation follows the Phase 2 design**
- [ ] **Complies with existing code conventions**
- [ ] **Has basic error handling**
- [ ] **No obvious bugs**

**Note**: Implementation of the test code is done in Phase 5 (test_implementation). Please implement only the actual code in Phase 4.
These quality gates are **mandatory requirements**. After implementation, a critical thinking review is conducted and modifications are required if the quality gates are not met.

## Notes

1. **Design compliance**: Do not deviate from the design document
- Change only the files described in the design document
- Implement according to the principles of the design document

2. **Respect existing code**: Maintain the existing style
- Match indentation and naming convention
- Follow existing patterns

3. **Step-by-step implementation**: Don't implement everything at once, do it in stages
- Start with core functionality
- Proceed as you test

4. **Safety**: Avoid risky operations
- Delete data carefully
- Specify if backup is required

5. **Be aware that it will be reviewed**: Implementation will undergo a critical thinking review
- Satisfy quality gates (5 essential requirements) as a top priority
- Be careful to avoid blockers (problems that prevent you from proceeding to the next phase)
- Clarify the intent of your implementation in comments

## Start implementation

Based on the above, implement code and test code, and create an implementation log.
