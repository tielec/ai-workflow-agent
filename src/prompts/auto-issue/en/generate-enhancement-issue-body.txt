**IMPORTANT: Write all document content in English. All sections, descriptions, and explanations must be in English.**

Generate a GitHub Issue body from the enhancement proposal below.

# Enhancement Proposal

{enhancement_proposal_json}

# Issue Body Format

Include these five sections in Markdown:

## Summary
(1-2 sentences on the proposal goal and expected value.)

## Background & Rationale
(Why this is needed: current pain points, who is affected, what problems it solves, expected benefits.)

## Proposal Details
(Spec, technical approach, implementation direction, and considerations.)

## Implementation Hints
(Recommended tech/libraries, references, phased plan if helpful, and cautions.)

## Action Items
(Checklist such as:)
- [ ] Refine requirements
- [ ] Validate feasibility
- [ ] Create implementation plan
- [ ] Start implementation
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Update docs

# Output Format

Write the issue **to the specified file**.

## Output File

**Path**: `{output_file_path}`

Write raw Markdown (no code fences) to that file. Do not print to stdout.

# Important Notes

1. Write in English
2. Be concrete about the proposal and how to build it
3. Include all five sections
4. **File output required**: write Markdown to `{output_file_path}`
5. Aim for ~200–500 characters per section
6. Do not wrap the output in ``` fences

# Expected Impact (`expected_impact`)
Express value appropriately:
- **high**: major user value or productivity gain
- **medium**: meaningful improvement
- **low**: limited or situational value

# Effort (`effort_estimate`)
Adjust plan detail:
- **large**: long-running; include a phased plan
- **medium**: moderate effort; outline key steps
- **small**: quick win; keep steps concise

# Proposal Type (`type`)
Highlight the right angle:
- **improvement**: emphasize current problems and benefits after improvement
- **integration**: emphasize benefits and scenarios for the integration
- **automation**: emphasize efficiency gains and manual work removed
- **dx**: emphasize developer experience and productivity
- **quality**: emphasize quality assurance and early defect detection
- **ecosystem**: emphasize extensibility and ecosystem growth

# Tone

- Positive and constructive
- Technically accurate
- Assume an engineer reader
- Clearly communicate the value
