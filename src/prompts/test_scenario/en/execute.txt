#Test Scenario Phase - Execution Prompt

## Task Summary
Create a detailed test scenario from the requirements definition and design documents. **Based on the testing strategy determined in Phase 2**, create scenarios for appropriate test types.

## Input Information

### Planning Phase Deliverables
- Planning Document: {planning_document_path}

**Note**: If the Planning Phase is being performed, be sure to review the development plan (implementation strategy, testing strategy, risks, schedule).

### Requirements definition document
{requirements_document_path}

### Design document
{design_document_path}

### Test strategy (determined in Phase 2)
**{test_strategy}**

### GitHub Issue information (reference)
{issue_info}

## Correspondence by test strategy

Create the following test scenarios according to the test strategy decided in Phase 2:

### UNIT_ONLY: Unit test only
- Test case for each function/method unit
- Normal system/abnormal system/boundary value test
- Unit test using mock/stub

### INTEGRATION_ONLY: Integration test only
- Integration testing between components
- Integration testing with external systems
- Data flow validation

### BDD_ONLY: BDD testing only
- User story-based scenarios
- Given-When-Then format
- Correspondence with business requirements

### UNIT_INTEGRATION: Unit + Integration
- Unit test scenario (above)
- Integration test scenario (above)

### UNIT_BDD: Unit + BDD
- Unit test scenario (above)
- BDD scenario (above)

### INTEGRATION_BDD: Integration + BDD
- Integration test scenario (above)
- BDD scenario (above)

### ALL: All
- Unit test scenario (above)
- Integration test scenario (above)
- BDD scenario (above)

## Test scenario configuration

### 1. Test strategy summary
- Selected test strategy (taken from Phase 2)
- Scope of test target
- Test purpose

### 2. Unit test scenario (if applicable)

For each function/method:
**Test case name**: (Function name_Normal system/Abnormal system/Boundary value)

- **Purpose**: What this test verifies
- **Prerequisites**: State before test execution
- **Input**: Input parameters to the function
- **Expected result**: Expected output/state change
- **Test data**: Test data used

**Example**:
```
Test case name: calculate_total_Successful
Purpose: Verify that the total amount is calculated correctly
Prerequisites: A list of products exists
Input: items = [{price: 100, quantity: 2}, {price: 200, quantity: 1}]
Expected result: 400 is returned
Test data: The above items
```

### 3. Integration Test Scenario (if applicable)

For each integration point:

**Scenario Name**: (Names of the two components to be integrated)

- **Purpose**: What this integration will verify
- **Prerequisites**: State before running the integration test
- **Test Steps**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Expected results**: Expected behavior after integration
- **Check items**: Checklist of points to check

### 4. BDD scenario (if applicable)

For each user story:

**Feature**: (Feature name)

**Scenario**: (Scenario name)

- **Given** (Prerequisites): Initial state of the system
- **When** (Operation): Action taken by the user
- **Then** (Result): Expected result

**Example**:
```gherkin
Feature: User registration feature

Scenario: New user can register successfully
Given User is not logged in
When User submits the registration form with a valid email address and password
Then User account is created
And A confirmation email is sent
And the user is redirected to the login screen
```

### 5. Test data
- Test data used in each test scenario
- Normal data, abnormal data, boundary value data

### 6. Test environment requirements
- Required test environment (local, CI/CD, etc.)
- Required external service database
- Mocks/Stubs Required

## Quality Gates (Phase 3)

Test scenarios must meet the following quality gates:

- [ ] **Test scenarios align with Phase 2 strategy**
- [ ] **Key normal systems are covered**- [ ] **Key abnormal systems are covered**
- [ ] **Expected results are clear**

These quality gates are **requirements**. After creation, a critical thinking review is conducted and revisions are required if the quality gates are not met.

## Notes

1. **Strategy compliance**: Please strictly adhere to the Phase 2 test strategy
- Test types not included in the strategy do not need to be created
- Example: For UNIT_ONLY, Integration/BDD scenario is not required

2. **Correspondence with requirements**: Make sure that each requirement in the requirements definition document is covered by the test
- Are the acceptance criteria reflected in the test scenario?
- Are all functional requirements included in the test target?

3. **Feasibility**: Describe a test scenario that can actually be executed
- Avoid ambiguous expressions
- Describe specific inputs and outputs
- Verifiable expected results

4. **Priority**: Focus on major cases, not all edge cases
- 80 points is enough (don't aim for perfection)
- Prioritize the critical path
- Cover high-risk areas first

5. **Keep in mind that it will be reviewed**: A critical thinking review will be conducted on the test scenario
- Satisfy the quality gates (4 essential requirements) with the highest priority
- Be careful to avoid blockers (problems that prevent you from proceeding to the next phase)

## Output format

Test scenario Save it as `.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/03_test_scenario/output/test-scenario.md`. Please use

Markdown format, use headings appropriately, and create highly readable documents.

## Start implementation

Create a test scenario based on the above.
