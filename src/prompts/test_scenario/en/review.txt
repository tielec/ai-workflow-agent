# Test Scenario Phase - Review Prompt

## Review Target
Please review the test scenario from a critical thinking perspective.

### Test scenario
{test_scenario_document_path}

### Design document (reference)
{design_document_path}

### Requirements definition document (reference)
{requirements_document_path}

### Test strategy (determined in Phase 2)
**{test_strategy}**

## Quality Gate (Phase 3)

The test scenario must clear the following quality gates:

- [ ] **The test scenario is in line with the strategy of Phase 2**
- [ ] **The main normal systems are covered**
- [ ] **The main abnormal systems are covered**
- [ ] **The expected results are clear**

## ⚠️ Important: Check with the Planning Phase checklist (required)

### 1. Load Planning.md

Please load the following file:
- {planning_document_path}

### 2. Extract the checklist for the relevant phase

From Planning.md, select the current phase ("### Phase 3:" or "## Phase 3:") section and extract the task checklist.

**Note**: If you can't find the checklist, please skip this check.

### 3. Check with the test scenario contents

Check whether each task is completed by checking against the test scenario (test-scenario.md).

**Completion criteria**:
- Are the test cases described in the Task written?
- Are the scenarios described in the Task implemented?
- Are all subtasks completed?

### 4. Update Planning.md

Please update the checkboxes in planning.md based on the verification results:

- Completed tasks: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
- Unfinished tasks: `- [ ]` Please use the

**Edit tool** to update the section for that phase.

### 5. Reflection in review judgment

- **All tasks completed** (all `[x]`): PASS or PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS
- **There are incomplete tasks** (`[ ]` remains): FAIL
- List incomplete tasks in review feedback
- Explain specifically what is missing

**Example (feedback on FAIL)**:```
## Planning Phase checklist verification result: FAIL

The following tasks are incomplete:

- [ ] Task 3-2: Creating an abnormal scenario
- Missing: Error handling scenarios are missing
- [ ] Task 3-3: Defining edge cases
- Missing: No boundary value test cases defined

Please complete these tasks and resubmit.
```

### ⚠️ Important: Do not include the contents of Planning.md in the review results

Although it is necessary to load and match Planning.md, **Please do not include the full text of planning.md or the review contents of Planning Phase in the review results**.

Review results should only include the following:
- Evaluation of the test scenario (test-scenario.md)
- Unfinished tasks found by checking against Planning.md (FAIL only)
- Test scenario-specific improvement suggestions

Do not output the review details of the Planning Phase or the entire contents of planning.md.

## Review Attitude

Please conduct this review based on the principle of "**80 points is good enough**":

1. **Aim for good enough, not perfect**
- Pass if the test scenario is ready for the next phase (implementation)
- It is not necessary to cover all edge cases
- OK if the main test cases are covered

2. **Clearly distinguish between blockers and improvement proposals**
- Blockers: Serious problems that prevent you from proceeding to the next phase (implementation)
- Improvement proposals: Items that you can proceed to the next phase but would like to improve

3. **Practical and balanced judgment**
- Prioritize moving the project forward
- Do not make blockers problems that can be fixed in the implementation phase

4. **Constructive feedback**
- Expression of "it would be better if we add more" instead of "lack"
- Present specific improvement proposals

## Review perspective

### 1. Consistency with test strategy (most important)

- Is it in line with the test strategy decided in Phase 2?
- UNIT_ONLY → Does only Unit test scenario exist?
- BDD_ONLY → Does only BDD scenario exist?
- UNIT_BDD → Are both scenarios present?
- Etc.
- Are test types not included in the strategy included?

### 2. Health coverage

- Are the normal systems of the main functions covered?
- Is the critical path tested?
- Is the happy path clearly defined?

### 3. Abnormal coverage
- Are the major error cases covered?
- Are there boundary value tests?
- Are the expected error handling tested?

### 4. Clarity of expected results

- Are the expected results of each test case specific?
- Are they stated in a verifiable (test-executable) manner?
- Are there any ambiguous expressions?

### 5. Correspondence with requirements

- Are the acceptance criteria in the requirements definition reflected in the test scenario?
- Are all functional requirements included in the test target?

### 6. Feasibility

- Can the test scenario actually be implemented and executed?
- Are the test data specifically defined?
- Are the prerequisites clear?

## ⚠️ Most important: Quality gate is an absolute requirement

**Quality gate (4 items) is an essential requirement. If even one of the criteria is not met, the judgment will automatically be FAIL. **

- The quality gate is a "minimum standard that must be cleared" and there is no room for negotiation.
- The principle of "80 points is enough" applies to improvement proposals after meeting the quality gate.
- Proceeding to the next phase is not allowed without meeting the quality gate.

## Distinguishing between blockers (BLOCKER) and improvement proposals (SUGGESTION)

### Blocker (BLOCKER): Serious problem that prevents you from proceeding to the next phase

**Blocker example**:
- Completely inconsistent with the test strategy (e.g. only BDD scenario even though it is UNIT_ONLY)
- Major normal systems are not covered at all
- Expected results are not described at all
- Test scenario cannot be implemented

### Improvement suggestions (SUGGESTION): Things that should be improved to proceed to the next phase

**Example of improvement proposal**:
- Additional edge case testing
- More detailed test data
- Expanding test coverage
- Adding test cases
- Enhancing documentation

### Judgment rule

#### PASS (Pass) PASS only if **all** below

are satisfied:
- ✅ **All 4 quality gates are met** (FAIL if any × is present)
- ✅ No blocker
- ✅ Only minor improvement suggestions (or no improvement suggestions)

#### PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS (conditional pass)

Only if **all** below are met:
- ✅ **All 4 quality gates are met** (FAIL if any of the Xs are present)
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Proceed to the next phase, but there are improvements to consider

#### FAIL

If any of the following **FAIL:
- ❌ **Even one of the quality gates (4 items) is not met**- ❌ One or more blockers exist

**Important: Quality gates are an absolute condition, and if one or more blockers are not met, it is an automatic FAIL. **

## Output format

Please output in the following format:

```markdown
## Quality gate evaluation

**⚠️ Important: Please explicitly judge PASS/FAIL for each item. If there is even one FAIL, the final judgment is automatically FAIL. **

- [x/ ] **Test scenario in line with Phase 2 strategy**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Reason for judgment)
- [x/ ] **Major normal systems are covered**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Reason for judgment)
- [x/ ] **Major abnormal systems are covered**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Reason for judgment)
- [x/ ] **Expected results are clear**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Judgment reason)

**Quality gate overall judgment: PASS / FAIL**
- PASS: All 4 items above are PASS
- FAIL: FAIL

**If the quality gate judgment is FAIL for any of the above 4 items, the final judgment will automatically be FAIL. **
