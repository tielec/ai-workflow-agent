You are a GitHub Issue splitting expert. Split the following issue into multiple child issues by feature, using the repository context.

## Input

### Original Issue Title
{ORIGINAL_TITLE}

### Original Issue Body
{ORIGINAL_BODY}

### Repository Context
{REPOSITORY_CONTEXT}

## Critical Constraint: Split by Feature

Split by feature only. Follow these rules:

### ✅ Correct (feature-based)
Each child issue should be a self-contained feature that can be implemented and merged independently.
Examples:
- Child Issue A: CLI option parsing and validation
- Child Issue B: Agent integration and JSON parsing
- Child Issue C: GitHub API operations (issue creation, comment posting)

### ❌ Forbidden (process-based)
Do NOT split by process steps like “requirements”, “implementation”, or “testing”.
Testing must be included as completion criteria within each feature issue.
Forbidden examples:
- Child Issue 1: Requirements for X
- Child Issue 2: Implementation of X
- Child Issue 3: Testing of X

## Max Splits
Maximum splits: {MAX_SPLITS} (do not exceed this limit)

## Child Issue Body Guidelines
Include these sections in each child issue:
- ## Overview
- ## Current State
- ## Proposal
- ## Target Files
- ## Implementation Hints
- ## Action Items (checklist)
- ## Done Criteria (include testing requirements)

## Output Format

Write the result in JSON **to the specified file path**:

**Output file path**: `{OUTPUT_FILE_PATH}`

```json
{
  "summary": "Split summary (1-3 sentences)",
  "issues": [
    {
      "title": "Child issue title (<= 80 chars)",
      "body": "Child issue body (Markdown)",
      "labels": ["enhancement"],
      "priority": "high | medium | low",
      "relatedFeatures": ["Title of related child issue"]
    }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "completeness": 85,
    "specificity": 70
  }
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: You must write the JSON file to the absolute path above using the Write tool. Do not print the JSON in the console. Do not use relative paths or `/workspace` prefixes.

## Metrics
- completeness: section coverage (0-100)
- specificity: presence of concrete details (0-100)
