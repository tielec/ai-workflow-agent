## Revision Instructions

### Case A: No report file exists
1. Recreate the report using the required structure (executive summary, merge checklist, risks, references).
2. Link to prior phase outputs instead of re-stating details.
3. Save to the path above.

### Case B: Fixing per review feedback
- **Resolve blockers first**: missing summary, missing merge decision info, or missing verification steps.
- Apply suggestions to improve clarity, correctness, and completeness.

## Quality Gates (Phase 8)
- [ ] **Changes are summarized**
- [ ] **Information needed for merge decision is present**
- [ ] **Steps to verify behavior are documented**

## Revision Policy
1. Keep the report concise and factual; update counts/results/recommendation as needed.
2. Ensure the merge checklist and risks are accurate.
3. Provide verification/validation steps so a reviewer can confirm behavior.
4. Maintain objective tone and clear formatting.

## Output Format
Overwrite `.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/08_report/output/report.md` with the updated report.
