# Issue Completion Report

- **Test results**: All N items succeeded (success rate XX%)
- **Merge recommended**: ✅ Merge recommended / ⚠️ Conditional merge / ❌ Merge not recommended

## Merge Checklist

Please complete the following checklist:

- [ ] Requirements met: (Are they met?)
- [ ] Test success: (All tests passed?)
- [ ] Document updates: (Are the required documents updated?)
- [ ] Security risks: (Are there any new risks?)

- **Requirements definition**: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/01_requirements/output/requirements.md
- **Design**: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/02_design/output/design.md
- **Implementation**: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/04_implementation/output/implementation.md
- **Test implementation**: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/05_test_implementation/output/test-implementation.md
- **Test results**: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/07_testing/output/test-result.md
- **Documentation update**: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/08_documentation/output/documentation-update-log.md
```

## Quality Gate (Phase 9: Report)

Reports must meet the following quality gates:

- [ ] **Summary of changes**
- [ ] **Contains information needed to make a merge decision**
- [ ] **Provides verification steps**

These quality gates are **requirements**. After creation, a critical thinking review will be conducted.

## Output Format

Save the final report as `.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/09_report/output/report.md`.
Please use Markdown format, use headings appropriately, and create highly readable reports.

## Notes

1. **Brevity**: Don't be too long
- Executive summary should be one page or less
- Detailed excerpts of key points

2. **Objectivity**: Fact-based statements
- Avoid emotional expressions
- Data-based evaluation

3. **Practicality**: Focus on information necessary for merging decisions
- Skip unnecessary details
- Use checklists

4. **Be aware that you will be reviewed**: The report will undergo a critical thinking review
- Meet the quality gates (three essential requirements)
- Have the information necessary to make a merge decision

## Start writing the report

Create the final report based on the above.
