# Report Phase - Execute Prompt

## Task Summary
Summarize all Phase 1–7 outputs into a final report for merge decision making. The report must contain everything a human needs to decide whether to merge.

## Inputs
- Planning Document: {planning_document_path}
- Requirements (if available): {requirements_context}
- Design (if available): {design_context}
- Implementation Log (if available): {implementation_context}
- Test Results (if available): {testing_context}
- Documentation Update Log (if available): {documentation_context}
- Test Scenario (reference): {test_scenario_context}
- Test Implementation Log (reference): {test_implementation_context}

## Report Steps

### 1. Executive Summary
Use this template:
```markdown
# Issue Completion Report

## Executive Summary

- **Issue**: #{issue_number}
- **Title**: {issue_title}
- **Implementation**: (1–2 sentence summary)
- **Change size**: New X, Updated Y, Deleted Z
- **Test results**: N total, pass rate XX%
- **Merge recommendation**: ✅ Recommend / ⚠️ Conditional / ❌ Not recommended

## Merge Checklist
- [ ] Requirements satisfied
- [ ] Tests passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security risks absent/covered
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
```

### 2. Risks/Notes
List any critical risks/concerns briefly; otherwise state "None".

### 3. References
Do **not** restate each phase in full. Link to outputs instead:
- Requirements: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/01_requirements/output/requirements.md
- Design: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/02_design/output/design.md
- Implementation: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/04_implementation/output/implementation.md
- Test Implementation: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/05_test_implementation/output/test-implementation.md
- Test Results: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/06_testing/output/test-result.md
- Documentation: @.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/07_documentation/output/documentation-update-log.md

## Quality Gates (Phase 8: Report)
- [ ] **Changes are summarized**
- [ ] **Information needed for merge decision is present**
- [ ] **Steps to verify behavior are documented**

## Output
Save the final report to `.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/08_report/output/report.md` in Markdown with clear headings and concise content.

## Notes
1. **Concise**: keep the executive summary within one page; include only essentials.
2. **Objective**: base statements on facts and data; avoid emotive language.
3. **Practical**: focus on information needed for the merge decision; use the checklist.
4. **Review awareness**: the report will be critically reviewed; ensure the three quality gates are met.
