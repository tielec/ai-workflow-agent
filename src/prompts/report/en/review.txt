# Report Phase - Review Prompt

## Review Targets
- Final report: {report_document_path}
- References: requirements/design/implementation/test results/doc updates as needed

## Quality Gates (Phase 8)
- [ ] **Changes are summarized**
- [ ] **Information needed for merge decision is present**
- [ ] **Steps to verify behavior are documented**

## Planning Checklist Alignment (required)
1. Read planning.md: {planning_document_path}
2. Extract the checklist for this phase ("### Phase 8:" or "## Phase 8:"); skip if none
3. Cross-check report.md to confirm each task is done
4. Update planning.md checkboxes with the Edit tool
5. Reflect in judgement: all tasks done → PASS or PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS; any incomplete → FAIL and list what is missing

Do not include full planning content—only list incomplete tasks when failing and report-specific feedback.

## Review Mindset
- Apply "80 points is good enough"
- Separate blockers (cannot proceed to Evaluation) from suggestions
- Keep feedback concise and actionable

## Review Points
- Executive summary clarity and accuracy (changes, tests, recommendation)
- Merge checklist completeness
- Risk/concern visibility
- Reference links instead of duplicating prior phase content
- Verification guidance present

## Judgement Rules

### PASS
- ✅ All three quality gates are met
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Only trivial or no suggestions

### PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS
- ✅ All three quality gates are met
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Can proceed but improvement points exist

### FAIL
- ❌ Any quality gate missing
- ❌ At least one blocker

Quality gates are mandatory; missing any gate forces FAIL.
