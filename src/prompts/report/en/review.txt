{report_document_path}

### Deliverables of each phase (reference)
- Phase 1 (Requirements): {requirements_context}
- Phase 2 (Design): {design_context}
- Phase 3 (Test Scenario): {test_scenario_context}
- Phase 4 (Implementation): {implementation_context}
- Phase 5 (Test Implementation): {test_implementation_context}

## Quality Gate (Phase 7: Report)

Reports must pass the following quality gates:

- [ ] **Summary of changes**
- [ ] **Contains the information needed to make a merge decision**
- [ ] **Contains operation verification steps**

## ⚠️ Important: Check against Planning Phase checklist (required)

### 1. Load Planning.md

Please load the following file:
- {planning_document_path}

### 2. Extract the checklist for the relevant phase

From Planning.md, find the section for the current phase ("### Phase 8:" or "## Phase 8:") and extract the task checklist.

**Note**: If you can't find the checklist, please skip this check.

### 3. Check with the report contents

Check whether each task has been completed by checking against the report (report.md).

**Completion criteria**:
- Are the items described in the Task described?
- Are the information described in the Task included?
- Are all subtasks completed?

### 4. Update Planning.md

Please update the checkboxes in planning.md based on the verification results:

- Completed tasks: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
- Unfinished tasks: `- [ ]` Please use the

**Edit tool** to update the section for that phase.

### 5. Reflection in review judgment

- **All tasks completed** (all `[x]`): PASS or PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS- **There are unfinished tasks** (`[ ]` remains): FAIL
- List unfinished tasks in review feedback
- Explain specifically what is missing

**Example (feedback at FAIL)**:
```
## Planning Phase checklist verification result: FAIL

The following tasks are incomplete:

- [ ] Task 8-2: Description of operation confirmation procedure
- Missing: Operation confirmation procedure is not described
- [ ] Task 8-3: Create release notes
- Missing: Release notes have not been created

Please complete these tasks and resubmit.
```

### ⚠️ Important: Do not include the contents of Planning.md in the review results

Although it is necessary to load and match Planning.md, **Please do not include the full text of planning.md or the review contents of Planning Phase in the review results**.

Review results should only include the following:
- Evaluation of the report (report.md)
- Unfinished tasks found by checking against Planning.md (FAIL only)
- Report-specific improvement suggestions

Do not output the review details of the Planning Phase or the entire contents of planning.md.

## Review Attitude

Please conduct this review based on the principle of "**80 points is enough**":

1. **Aim for sufficiency, not perfection**
- Not every detail needs to be perfect
- Pass if you have the information necessary to make a merge decision
- Describe small improvements as improvement suggestions

2. **Clearly distinguish between blockers and improvement suggestions**
- Blockers: Serious defects that make it impossible to make a merge decision
- Improvement suggestions: Suggestions for a better report

3. **Practical and balanced judgment**
- Prioritize that the reviewer can make a merge decision
- Pass if the required information is clear

4. **Constructive feedback**
- In addition to pointing out deficiencies, present concrete improvement suggestions
- Evaluate the good points of the report

## Review perspective

### 1. Summary of changes (most important)

- Is the executive summary clear?
- Can the implementation content be understood in 1-2 sentences?
- Does the business value be explained?
- Is the summary of the technical change described?

### 2. Information necessary for merging decisions

- Is the risk assessment clear (classified as high/medium/low)?
- Is the merge recommendation decision clearly stated (✅/⚠️/❌)?
- Is the reason for the decision logical?
- If it is a conditional recommendation, are the conditions clear?

### 3. Operation confirmation procedure
- Are test results documented?
- Are merge checklists practical?
- Are next steps clear?
- Are rollback steps, if necessary, documented?

### 4. Integrating information from each phase

- Are important information from Phases 1-6 appropriately extracted?
- Are there any duplications or inconsistencies in information?
- Is the structure easy to read?

## ⚠️ Most important: Quality gates are an absolute requirement

**Quality gates (3 items) are mandatory requirements. If even one of the criteria is not met, the judgment will automatically be FAIL. **

- The quality gate is a "minimum standard that must be cleared" and there is no room for negotiation.
- The principle of "80 points is enough" applies to improvement proposals after meeting the quality gate.
- Proceeding to the next phase is not allowed without meeting the quality gate.

## Distinguishing between blockers (BLOCKER) and improvement proposals (SUGGESTION)

### Blocker (BLOCKER): Serious defect that prevents merge decision

**Blocker example**:
- Executive summary does not exist
- Merge recommendation decision is not described
- Implementation details are not explained at all
- Risk assessment is not described at all
- Test results are not described at all

### Improvement suggestion (SUGGESTION): Suggestion for a better report

**Example of improvement suggestion**:
- The explanation of the business value is weak
- I want more details about the technical changes
- It is desirable to add items to the merge checklist
- It would be good if the next step is a little more specific
- Improving the format

### Decision rule

#### PASS (Pass)

PASS only if **all** below are met:
- ✅ **All three quality gates are met** (FAIL if there is any ×)
- ✅ No blocker
- ✅ Only minor improvement suggestions (or no improvement suggestions)

#### PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS (conditional pass)

PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS only if **all** below:
- ✅ **All three quality gates are met** (FAIL if there is any ×)
- ✅ No blocker exists
- ✅ Proceed to the next phase, but there are improvements to consider

#### FAIL (Fail)
__If any of the following ** are applicable, FAIL:
- ❌ **At least one of the quality gates (3 items) is not met**
- ❌ One or more blockers exist

** Important: Quality gates are absolute conditions, and if even one is not met, it is automatically FAIL. **

## Output format

Please output in the following format:

```markdown## Quality Gate Evaluation

**⚠️ Important: Please explicitly judge PASS/FAIL for each item. If there is even one FAIL, the final judgment is automatically FAIL. **

- [x/ ] **Summary of changes**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Reason for judgment)
- [x/ ] **Information necessary for merging decision is complete**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Reason for judgment)
- [x/ ] **Procedure for checking operation is described**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Judgment reason)

**Quality gate overall judgment: PASS / FAIL**
- PASS: All three items above are PASS
- FAIL: Even one of the above three items is FAIL

**If the quality gate judgment is FAIL, the final judgment will be automatically FAIL. **
