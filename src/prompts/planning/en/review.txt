# Project Plan Review - Review Prompt

## Task Summary

Review the created project plan with critical thinking to confirm feasibility and quality.

## Plan

{planning_document_path}

## Review Viewpoints

Check the plan from these angles:

### 1. Feasibility
- **Estimate validity**: are task estimates realistic?
- **Resource sufficiency**: are time and skills sufficient?
- **Technical feasibility**: are the proposed technologies/approaches workable?
- **Dependency consistency**: are task dependencies logically sound?

### 2. Task Breakdown Quality
- **Granularity**: each task is ~1–4 hours
- **Clear done criteria**: completion conditions are explicit
- **Independence**: tasks can be implemented/tested independently
- **Coverage**: all Issue TODOs are reflected as tasks

### 3. Risk Analysis Coverage
- **Risk categories covered**: technical, scope, resource, dependency
- **Impact/likelihood soundness**: ratings are appropriate
- **Concrete mitigations**: each risk has a specific mitigation
- **Missed risks**: no obvious critical risks are missing

### 4. Strategy Decisions
- **Implementation strategy**: CREATE/EXTEND/REFACTOR choice is appropriate (must check)
- **Test strategy**: UNIT_ONLY/.../ALL choice is appropriate (must check)
- **Test code strategy**: EXTEND_TEST/CREATE_TEST/BOTH_TEST choice is appropriate (must check)
- **Rationale**: reasons for each strategy are clearly stated

### 5. Quality Gates

Verify all gates are satisfied:

- [ ] **Implementation strategy is decided** (CREATE/EXTEND/REFACTOR)
- [ ] **Test strategy is decided** (UNIT_ONLY/.../ALL)
- [ ] **Test code strategy is decided** (EXTEND_TEST/CREATE_TEST/BOTH_TEST)
- [ ] **Impact analysis is done**
- [ ] **Task breakdown uses proper granularity** (1 task = 1–4 hours)
- [ ] **Risks are identified**

## Review Judgement Rules

Rate the result in three levels:

### Most Important: Quality gates are mandatory

**The 6 quality gates are mandatory. If any gate is missing, the result is automatically FAIL.**

- Gates are the minimum bar; non-negotiable
- The "80% is good enough" rule applies only after gates are satisfied
- Do not proceed to the next phase if gates are unmet

### PASS

All of the following:
- ✅ **All 6 quality gates are met** (any miss = FAIL)
- ✅ No blockers (issues that prevent moving to the next phase)
- ✅ Plan is executable and well-structured
- ✅ No or only trivial suggestions (typos, etc.)

### PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS

All of the following:
- ✅ **All 6 quality gates are met** (any miss = FAIL)
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Improvement areas exist but work can proceed
- ⚠️ Provide suggestions, but execution is still possible now

### FAIL

If **any** of these applies:
- ❌ Any of the 6 quality gates is not met
- ❌ At least one blocker exists
- ❌ Plan is infeasible or structurally flawed

**Important**:
- A blocker is something that will certainly cause problems in the next phase
- Suggestions are for improvement and are not blockers
- **Quality gates are absolute; missing any gate forces FAIL**

## Examples of Blockers

These are examples that must trigger FAIL if present:

1. **Strategies undefined**: implementation/test/test-code strategies not documented
2. **Bad task sizing**: tasks too big (8h+) or too small (<15 min)
3. **Circular dependencies**: task A depends on B and B depends on A
4. **Impossible estimates**: clearly unrealistic short estimates
5. **Missing critical risks**: obvious major risks not listed

## Examples of Suggestions

These go under PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS:

1. **Improve estimate accuracy**: add buffer for safety
2. **Detail risk mitigations**: make mitigations more concrete
3. **Further split tasks**: smaller units for easier tracking
4. **Add quality gates**: include stricter checks

## Output Format

Write the review result in this format:

## Review Result

**Decision: PASS / PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS / FAIL**

## Feasibility

(Comments on feasibility)

## Task Breakdown Quality

(Comments on task breakdown)

## Risk Analysis Coverage

(Comments on risk analysis)

## Strategy Decisions

(Comments on strategy choices)

## Quality Gate Check

**Important: Give an explicit PASS/FAIL for each item. If any is FAIL, the final decision is automatically FAIL.**

- [x/ ] Implementation strategy is decided: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [x/ ] Test strategy is decided: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [x/ ] Test code strategy is decided: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [x/ ] Impact analysis is done: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [x/ ] Task breakdown uses proper granularity: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [x/ ] Risks are identified: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)

**Quality gate overall judgement: PASS / FAIL**
- PASS: all 6 items are PASS
- FAIL: any of the 6 items is FAIL

If the quality gate judgement is FAIL, the final decision is automatically FAIL.

## Notes

1. **Objectivity**: avoid emotion or subjectivity; base the review on facts
2. **Constructive**: provide concrete improvement ideas, not just criticism
3. **Clarity**: clearly separate blockers from suggestions
4. **Completeness**: cover all review viewpoints
