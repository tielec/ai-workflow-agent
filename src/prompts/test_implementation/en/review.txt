# Test Implementation Phase - Review Prompt

## Review Targets
- Test implementation log: {test_implementation_document_path}
- Test files referenced in the log
- Test Scenario (reference): {test_scenario_document_path}
- Implementation log (reference): {implementation_document_path}
- Test Strategy (Phase 2): **{test_strategy}**

## Quality Gates (Phase 5)
- [ ] **All Phase 3 scenarios are implemented**
- [ ] **Test code is runnable**
- [ ] **Test intent is clear (comments/structure)**

## Planning Checklist Alignment (required)
1. Read planning.md: {planning_document_path}
2. Extract the checklist for this phase ("### Phase 5:" or "## Phase 5:"); skip if none
3. Cross-check test-implementation.md and test files to confirm each task is done
4. Update planning.md checkboxes with the Edit tool
5. Reflect in judgement: all tasks done → PASS or PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS; any incomplete → FAIL and list what is missing

Do not include full planning content in the review output—only list incomplete tasks when failing and test-specific feedback.

## Review Mindset
- Apply "80 points is good enough"
- Separate blockers (cannot proceed to Testing) from suggestions
- Keep feedback constructive and actionable

## Review Points
- Alignment with `{test_strategy}` and Phase 3 scenarios
- Completeness of unit/integration/BDD tests as applicable
- Executability (setup/mocks/data clear, tests run without missing deps)
- Clarity of intent and assertions
- No production-code changes introduced in this phase

## Judgement Rules

### PASS
- ✅ All three quality gates are met
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Only trivial or no suggestions

### PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS
- ✅ All three quality gates are met
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Can proceed but improvement points exist

### FAIL
- ❌ Any quality gate missing
- ❌ At least one blocker

Quality gates are mandatory; missing any gate forces FAIL.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Quality Gate Check

**Important: Mark PASS/FAIL explicitly; any FAIL makes the final decision FAIL.**

- [ ] All Phase 3 scenarios implemented: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [ ] Test code is runnable: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [ ] Test intent is clear: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)

**Quality gate overall judgement: PASS / FAIL**
