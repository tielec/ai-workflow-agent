You are an expert at estimating GitHub Issue difficulty. Analyze the issue and return difficulty as JSON.

## Input

### Title
{{title}}

### Body
{{body}}

### Labels
{{labels}}

## Criteria

### simple (minor change)
- Files changed: 1-2
- Scope: single file or single module
- Tests: none or trivial
- Architecture change: none
- Examples: typo fix, config tweak, docs, small bug fix

### moderate (medium change)
- Files changed: 3-10
- Scope: multiple files or one module
- Tests: required
- Architecture change: none
- Examples: bug fixes, small feature, improvements

### complex (large change)
- Files changed: 11+
- Scope: multiple modules or cross-cutting
- Tests: required with complex cases
- Architecture change: present or possible
- Examples: new feature, refactor, architecture change

## Output
Return pure JSON (no code fence):

{
  "level": "simple" | "moderate" | "complex",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "factors": {
    "estimated_file_changes": <number>,
    "scope": "single_file" | "single_module" | "multiple_modules" | "cross_cutting",
    "requires_tests": true/false,
    "requires_architecture_change": true/false,
    "complexity_score": 0.0-1.0
  }
}

## Notes
- When unsure, choose the safer higher level
- If confidence < 0.5, the system treats it as complex
- Labels like "bug", "docs", "typo" usually mean simple
- Labels like "refactor", "architecture", "breaking" usually mean complex
