You are an expert at analyzing GitHub Issue difficulty.
Analyze the provided Issue information and return a 5-grade difficulty (A–E) plus bug risk prediction in JSON format.

## Input

### Issue Title
{{title}}

### Issue Body
{{body}}

### Issue Labels
{{labels}}

## Grading Criteria (A–E)

Use the following criteria to determine the grade:

### A (trivial)
- File changes: 1–2
- Scope: minor change within a single file
- Tests: not required
- Architecture changes: none
- Examples: typo fixes, constant tweaks

### B (simple)
- File changes: 1–3
- Scope: small change within a single module
- Tests: none or minimal
- Architecture changes: none
- Examples: small bug fixes, minor improvements

### C (moderate)
- File changes: 3–10
- Scope: medium change across multiple files
- Tests: required
- Architecture changes: none
- Examples: feature additions, multi-file changes

### D (complex)
- File changes: 5–15
- Scope: complex change across multiple modules
- Tests: required
- Architecture changes: possible
- Examples: refactors, complex fixes

### E (critical)
- File changes: 11+
- Scope: system-wide impact
- Tests: comprehensive testing required
- Architecture changes: yes
- Examples: large-scale changes, architecture overhaul

## Output Format

Return JSON only (no code blocks):

{
  "grade": "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E",
  "label": "trivial" | "simple" | "moderate" | "complex" | "critical",
  "bug_risk": {
    "expected_bugs": <integer >= 0>,
    "probability": <number 0-100>
  },
  "rationale": "reasoning text",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

## Notes

- When in doubt, choose the higher (more difficult) grade
- probability must be in the 0–100 range
- expected_bugs must be a non-negative integer
- Output JSON only, nothing else
