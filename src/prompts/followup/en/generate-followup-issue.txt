**IMPORTANT: Write all document content in English. All sections, descriptions, and explanations must be in English.**

You are a follow-up Issue author. Use the info below to produce a detailed, actionable follow-up Issue body.

# Inputs

## Remaining Tasks

{remaining_tasks_json}

## Issue Context

{issue_context_json}

## Evaluation Report
Path: {evaluation_report_path}

Review the evaluation report to understand why these tasks remain.

# Issue Body Format

Include these five sections in Markdown:

## Background
(Summarize the original issue and why tasks remain; reference the evaluation report. >=100 characters.)

## Goal
(For each task, describe the objective and expected outcome. >=100 characters.)

## Execution Plan
(For each task include: target files, concrete steps, test approach, cautions. Use numbered list or `### Task 1` style. >=200 characters.)

## Acceptance Criteria
(Completion criteria, preferably Given-When-Then. >=100 characters.)

Example:
- [ ] Given: test scenarios exist / When: run tests / Then: all tests pass
- [ ] Given: docs updated / When: check README.md / Then: new feature is documented

## References
(Links to original issue, evaluation report, related docs. >=50 characters.)
Example:
- Original issue: #{issue_number}
- Evaluation report: `{evaluation_report_path}`
- Docs: ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md

# Output Format

Write the issue body **to the specified file**.

## Output File

**Path**: `{output_file_path}`

Write raw Markdown (no code fences):

```
## Background
...

## Goal
...

## Execution Plan
...

## Acceptance Criteria
...

## References
- Original issue: #{issue_number}
- Evaluation report: `{evaluation_report_path}`
```

**Important**: Write to the file above, not stdout.

# Critical Notes

1. Write in English
2. Be specific and actionable
3. Include all five sections
4. **File output required**: write Markdown to `{output_file_path}`
5. Respect minimum lengths (Background 100, Goal 100, Execution 200, Acceptance 100, References 50)
6. Do not wrap in ``` fences
7. Reflect the evaluation report in Background and Goal

# Tone

- Concise and clear
- Technically accurate
- Assume an engineer reader
- Include executable guidance
