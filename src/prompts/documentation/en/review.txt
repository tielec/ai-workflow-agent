# Documentation Phase - Review Prompt

## Review Targets
- Documentation update log: {documentation_update_log_path}
- Updated documents listed in the log
- Implementation/Test/Design/Requirements as references where needed

## Quality Gates (Phase 7)
- [ ] **Affected documents are identified**
- [ ] **Needed documents are updated**
- [ ] **Updates are recorded**

## Planning Checklist Alignment (required)
1. Read planning.md: {planning_document_path}
2. Extract the checklist for this phase ("### Phase 7:" or "## Phase 7:"); skip if none
3. Cross-check the log and documents to confirm each task is done
4. Update planning.md checkboxes with the Edit tool
5. Reflect in judgement: all tasks done → PASS or PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS; any incomplete → FAIL and list what is missing

Do not include full planning content—only list incomplete tasks when failing and doc-specific feedback.

## Review Mindset
- Apply "80 points is good enough"
- Separate blockers (cannot proceed to Report) from suggestions
- Preserve existing document style; keep feedback actionable

## Review Points
- Coverage of affected docs based on implementation/tests
- Accuracy and clarity of updates
- Consistency with project style and other phases' outputs
- Completeness of the update log (only updated files listed with reasons)

## Judgement Rules

### PASS
- ✅ All three quality gates are met
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Only trivial or no suggestions

### PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS
- ✅ All three quality gates are met
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Can proceed but improvement points exist

### FAIL
- ❌ Any quality gate missing
- ❌ At least one blocker

Quality gates are mandatory; missing any gate forces FAIL.
