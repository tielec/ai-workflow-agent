Extract decision and related info from the evaluation report.

# Evaluation Report
{evaluation_content}

# Targets
1. **decision**: one of PASS, PASS_WITH_ISSUES, FAIL_PHASE_*, ABORT
2. **failedPhase**: when decision is FAIL_PHASE_*, one of planning, requirements, design, test_scenario, implementation, test_implementation, testing, documentation, report
3. **abortReason**: when decision is ABORT, explanatory text
4. **remainingTasks**: when decision is PASS_WITH_ISSUES, list of remaining tasks

# Output
Return JSON only:
{
  "decision": "PASS_WITH_ISSUES",
  "failedPhase": null,
  "abortReason": null,
  "remainingTasks": [
    {
      "task": "Task description",
      "phase": "Phase name",
      "priority": "High"
    }
  ]
}

# Decision Types
- **PASS**: all artifacts meet the bar
- **PASS_WITH_ISSUES**: mostly pass with follow-up tasks (extract remainingTasks)
- **FAIL_PHASE_<phase>**: critical issues in a specific phase require redo (populate failedPhase)
  - Examples: FAIL_PHASE_DESIGN -> failedPhase "design"; FAIL_PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION -> "implementation"
- **ABORT**: fatal issues stop the project (populate abortReason)

# Notes
- If not stated, default `decision` to "PASS"
- Remaining tasks come from the "## 残タスク" section formatted as `- [ ] task (Phase: xxx, 優先度: xxx)`
- Output pure JSON (no ```json fences)
- Do not add explanations
- failedPhase must be the phase name only from the allowed list
- Map FAIL_PHASE identifiers to the correct phase name (e.g., FAIL_PHASE_2 -> "design")
