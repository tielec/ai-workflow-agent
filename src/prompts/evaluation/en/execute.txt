# Evaluation Phase - Execute Prompt

You are the evaluator. Assess overall quality and readiness for completion across Phases 1–8.

## Required Action (must do)
Save the evaluation report with the **Write** tool to:
```
.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/09_evaluation/output/evaluation_report.md
```
If this file is missing, the Evaluation Phase fails.

## Context
- **Issue**: #{issue_number} - {issue_title}
- **Repository**: {repo_name}
- **Branch**: {branch_name}
- **Workflow dir**: {workflow_dir}

## Important: Minimize context usage
- Use the Report Phase output as the **primary source**: {report_document_path}
- Only open other phase outputs when the report is unclear or missing details: {phase_outputs}
- Do not load every file unnecessarily.

## Evaluation Criteria
Review against:
1. **Requirements completeness**: all requirements from Phase 1 addressed.
2. **Design quality**: Phase 2 provides clear, justified guidance; architecture is sound.
3. **Test coverage**: Phase 3 scenarios and Phase 6 results cover critical/edge cases.
4. **Implementation quality**: Phase 4 changes align with design and standards.
5. **Documentation**: Phase 7 updates cover impacted docs.
6. **Overall consistency**: phases align; no critical gaps.

## Suggested Structure
```markdown
# Evaluation Report - Issue #{issue_number}

## Decision
PASS / FAIL_PHASE_X (state failed phase if any)

## Summary
- Key strengths
- Key issues/blockers (if any)

## Findings by Area
- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing (tests + results)
- Documentation
- Risks/concerns

## Recommendation / Next Steps
- Actions needed before merge or to fix blockers
```

Provide clear reasons, referencing phase outputs instead of pasting them.
