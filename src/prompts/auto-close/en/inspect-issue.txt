## Recommendation Guide
- Recommend "close" when tasks are done, source Issue is closed, relevance is low, or it is a duplicate.
- Recommend "keep" when active, important (security/performance), or has clear remaining tasks.
- Recommend "needs_discussion" when uncertain or stakeholder confirmation is required.

Focus on clear reasoning, honest confidence scoring, and respectful close_comment content.
