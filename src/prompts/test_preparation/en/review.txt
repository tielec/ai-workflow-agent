# Test Preparation Phase - Review Prompt

**IMPORTANT: Write all document content in English. All sections, descriptions, and explanations must be in English.**

## Review Targets

### Test preparation document
{test_preparation_document_path}

### Implementation log (reference)
{implementation_document_path}

### Test implementation log (reference)
{test_implementation_document_path}

## Quality Gates (Phase 6)

Test preparation must satisfy the following quality gates:

- [ ] **Language runtime is installed correctly**
- [ ] **Dependencies are resolved**
- [ ] **Test framework is available**

## ⚠️ Important: Cross-check with Planning Phase checklist (Required)

### 1. Read planning.md

Read the following file:
- {planning_document_path}

### 2. Extract the relevant checklist section

Find the section for the current phase ("### Phase 6:" or "## Phase 6:") and extract the task checklist.

**Note**: If no checklist is found, skip this check.

### 3. Cross-check with test preparation content

Compare the checklist with test-preparation.md and verify each task is completed.

**Completion criteria**:
- Required runtimes are installed
- Dependency installation is complete
- Validation steps are recorded

### 4. Update planning.md

Update the checkboxes based on the comparison:

- Completed tasks: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
- Incomplete tasks: leave `- [ ]`

**Use the Edit tool** to update the relevant section.

### 5. Reflect in review decision

- **All tasks completed** (all `[x]`): PASS or PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS
- **Any tasks incomplete** (`[ ]` remains): FAIL
  - List the incomplete tasks in the feedback
  - Explain what is missing

**Example (FAIL feedback)**:
```
## Planning Phase checklist result: FAIL

The following tasks are incomplete:

- [ ] Task 6-1: Test runner setup
  - Missing: pytest installation is not recorded
- [ ] Task 6-2: Dependency resolution
  - Missing: npm install results are not documented

Complete these tasks and resubmit.
```

### ⚠️ Important: Do not include planning.md content in the review result

Reading and updating planning.md is required, but **do not include the full planning.md content** in the review output.

Only include:
- Evaluation of test-preparation.md
- Incomplete tasks found via planning.md (only when FAIL)
- Improvement suggestions specific to test preparation

## Review Stance

Follow the "80 points is enough" principle:

1. **Aim for sufficient, not perfect**
   - If testing can proceed, pass the review
   - Minor optimizations go into suggestions

2. **Separate blockers from suggestions**
   - Blocker: cannot proceed to Testing
   - Suggestion: can proceed but improvements are desirable

3. **Practical and balanced judgment**
   - Prioritize moving the project forward

4. **Constructive feedback**
   - Provide concrete improvement guidance

## Review Criteria

### 1. Runtime readiness (most important)

- Required runtimes are installed
- Version checks are recorded

### 2. Dependency resolution

- Dependency installation completed
- No unresolved installation errors

### 3. Test readiness

- Test framework is available
- Test command checks are recorded

### 4. Accuracy of records

- Commands and results are accurately captured
- Risks or limitations are noted for the next phase
