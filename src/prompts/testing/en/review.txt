# Testing Phase - Review Prompt

## Review Targets
- Test result log: {test_result_document_path}
- Test Implementation log (reference): {test_implementation_document_path}
- Implementation log (reference): {implementation_document_path}
- Test Scenario (reference): {test_scenario_document_path}

## Quality Gates (Phase 6)
- [ ] **Tests were executed**
- [ ] **Key test cases passed**
- [ ] **Failures (if any) are analyzed**

## Planning Checklist Alignment (required)
1. Read planning.md: {planning_document_path}
2. Extract the checklist for this phase ("### Phase 6:" or "## Phase 6:"); skip if none
3. Cross-check test-result.md to confirm each task is done
4. Update planning.md checkboxes with the Edit tool
5. Reflect in judgement: all tasks done → PASS or PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS; any incomplete → FAIL and list what is missing

Do not include full planning content in the review output—only list incomplete tasks when failing and testing-specific feedback.

## Review Mindset
- Apply "80 points is good enough"
- Separate blockers (cannot proceed to Documentation) from suggestions
- Be objective; report failures honestly

## Review Points
- Execution completeness (full suite run; skips justified)
- Pass/fail summary accuracy
- Failure analysis quality (causes, next steps)
- Alignment with scenarios and implemented tests

## Judgement Rules

### PASS
- ✅ All three quality gates are met
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Only trivial or no suggestions

### PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS
- ✅ All three quality gates are met
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Can proceed but improvement points exist

### FAIL
- ❌ Any quality gate missing
- ❌ At least one blocker

Quality gates are mandatory; missing any gate forces FAIL.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Quality Gate Check

**Important: Mark PASS/FAIL explicitly; any FAIL makes the final decision FAIL.**

- [ ] Tests were executed: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [ ] Key test cases passed: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)
- [ ] Failures are analyzed: **PASS / FAIL** - (reason)

**Quality gate overall judgement: PASS / FAIL**
