# Test execution phase - Review prompt

**IMPORTANT: Write all document content in English. All sections, descriptions, and explanations must be in English.**

## Review target

### Test result
{test_result_document_path}

### Implementation log (reference)
{implementation_document_path}

### Test scenario (reference)
{test_scenario_document_path}

## Quality gate (Phase 5)

Test execution must pass the following quality gates:

- [ ] **Tests are being executed**
- [ ] **Key test cases are passing**
- [ ] **Failing tests are being analyzed**

## ⚠️ Important: Check against Planning Phase checklist (required)

### 1. Load Planning.md

Please load the following file:
- {planning_document_path}

### 2. Extract the checklist for the relevant phase

From Planning.md, find the section for the current phase ("### Phase 7:" or "## Phase 7:") and extract the task checklist.

**Note**: If you can't find the checklist, please skip this check.

### 3. Check with test execution contents

Check whether each task has been completed by checking against the test results (test-result.md).

**Completion Criteria**:
- Are the tests described in the Task executed?
- Are the test cases described in the Task verified?
- Are all subtasks completed?

### 4. Update Planning.md

Please update the checkboxes in planning.md based on the verification results:

- Completed tasks: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
- Unfinished tasks: `- [ ]` Please use the

**Edit tool** to update the section for that phase.

### 5. Reflection in review judgment

- **All tasks completed** (all `[x]`): PASS or PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS
- **There are incomplete tasks** (`[ ]` remains): FAIL
- List incomplete tasks in review feedback
- Explain specifically what is missing

**Example (feedback at FAIL)**:
```
## Planning Phase checklist verification result: FAIL

The following tasks are incomplete:

- [ ] Task 6-2: Executing integration tests
- Missing: Integration tests have not been executed- [ ] Task 6-3: Perform Performance Tests
- Missing: No performance test results recorded

Please complete these tasks and resubmit.
```

### ⚠️ Important: Do not include the contents of Planning.md in the review results

Although it is necessary to load and match Planning.md, **Please do not include the full text of planning.md or the review contents of Planning Phase in the review results**.

Review results should only include the following:
- Evaluation of test results (test-result.md)
- Incomplete tasks found by checking with Planning.md (FAIL only)
- Improvement suggestions specific to test results

Do not output the review details of the Planning Phase or the entire contents of planning.md.

## Review Attitude

This review should be conducted according to the "80 points is good enough" principle:

1. **Aim for good enough, not perfect**
- Not all tests need to pass
- Pass if key test cases are successful
- Document failures in edge cases as improvement suggestions

2. **Clearly distinguish between blockers and improvement suggestions**
- Blockers: Serious issues that prevent you from moving on to the next phase (document creation)
- Improvement suggestions: Things you can move on to the next phase but would like to improve

3. **Practical and balanced judgment**
- Prioritize moving the project forward
- Pass if critical features are working

4. **Constructive feedback**
- Don't blame test failures
- Provide specific improvement plans

## Review perspective

### 1. Confirm test execution (most important)

- Are the tests actually executed?
- Are the test execution commands recorded?
- Are the test outputs recorded?

### 2. Success of the main test cases

- Are the critical path tests successful?
- Are the normal tests successful?
- Are the basic functions working?

### 3. Analysis of failed tests

- If there is a failed test, is the cause analyzed?
- Is a countermeasure specified?
- Is the severity of the failure evaluated?

### 4. Test scope

- Is the scope covered by the test scenario tested?
- Are the main functions included in the test?

## ⚠️ Most important: Quality gates are an absolute requirement

**Quality gates (3 items) are mandatory requirements. If even one of the criteria is not met, the judgment will automatically be FAIL. **

- Quality gate is a "minimum standard that must be cleared" and is non-negotiable- The principle of "80 points is enough" applies to improvement proposals after meeting the quality gate
- It is not allowed to proceed to the next phase without meeting the quality gate

## Distinction between BLOCKER and improvement suggestion (SUGGESTION)

### BLOCKER: A serious problem that prevents you from proceeding to the next phase

**Blocker example**:
- No tests have been executed
- All tests have failed
- Tests for critical functions have failed
- The causes of test failures have not been analyzed at all

### SUGGESTION: Proceed to the next phase, but what should be improved

**Examples of improvement suggestions**:
- Tests for edge cases have failed
- Tests for some non-critical functions have failed
- Expanding test coverage
- Additional investigation for test failures

### Decision rule

#### PASS (Pass)

PASS only if **all** below are met:
- ✅ **All three quality gates are met** (FAIL if even one is)
- ✅ Blocker does not exist
- ✅ Minor improvement suggestions only (or no improvement suggestions)

#### PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS

PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS only if all of the following are met:
- ✅ **All three quality gates are met** (FAIL if any of them are)
- ✅ No blockers
- ✅ Moving on to the next phase, but there are improvements to consider

#### FAIL (FAIL)

If any of the following** apply: FAIL:
- ❌ **One or more of the quality gates (3 items) are not met**
- ❌ One or more blockers exist

** Important: Quality gates are absolute requirements, and if even one is not met, it is an automatic FAIL. **

## Output format

Please output in the following format:

```markdown
## Quality gate evaluation

**⚠️ Important: Please explicitly judge PASS/FAIL for each item. If there is even one FAIL, the final judgment is automatically FAIL. **

- [x/ ] **Tests are being executed**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Decision reason)
- [x/ ] **Key test cases are passing**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Decision reason)
- [x/ ] **Failing tests are being analyzed**: **PASS / FAIL** - (Decision reason)

**Quality gate overall verdict: PASS / FAIL**
- PASS: All 3 items above are PASS
- FAIL: Any one of the 3 items above is FAIL
**If the quality gate judgment is FAIL, the final judgment will automatically be FAIL. **
