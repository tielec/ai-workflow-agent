# Testing Phase - Execute Prompt

## Task Summary
Run the tests implemented in Phase 5 and record the results.

## When this phase is considered unnecessary (Issue #411)

Even if you decide test execution is unnecessary, **you must still create `test-result.md`** or the workflow will fail.

**Skip criteria examples**: Phase 5 tests were skipped, docs-only changes, file deletions, minor config tweaks, or no code under test.

**Required skip template**:
```markdown
# Test Results

## Skip Decision
Test execution is unnecessary for this issue.

## Reasoning
- (List specific reasons)

## Recommendation
Proceed to Phase 7 (Documentation).
```

If Phase 5 recorded a skip, this phase is recommended to skip as well.

## Inputs
- Planning Document: {planning_document_path}
- Test Implementation Log (if available): {test_implementation_context}
- Implementation Log (if available): {implementation_context}
- Test Scenario (if available): {test_scenario_context}
- GitHub Issue: {issue_info}

## Test Execution Steps
1. Review the test files listed in the test implementation log (paths, framework, commands).
2. Execute the appropriate test command (examples):
   - Pytest: `pytest tests/`
   - Unittest: `python -m unittest discover tests/`
   - Behave: `behave tests/features/`
   - Or project-specific commands from @README.md / @CONTRIBUTION.md
3. Record results in this format and save to `.ai-workflow/issue-{issue_number}/06_testing/output/test-result.md`:
```markdown
# Test Results

## Test Summary
- Total: X
- Passed: Y
- Failed: Z
- Pass rate: XX%

## Conditional Output
**If failures == 0**:
✅ All tests passed.

**If failures > 0**: list only failing tests:
### `tests/test_xxx.py::test_function_name`
- **Error**: (message)
- **Stack trace**:
  ```
  (relevant excerpt)
  ```

Do not list successful tests.
```

## Quality Gates (Phase 6)
- [ ] **Tests were executed**
- [ ] **Key test cases passed**
- [ ] **Failures (if any) are analyzed**

## Notes
1. **Environment**: ensure deps and test data are prepared.
2. **Failure analysis**: capture errors, identify causes, and outline fixes.
3. **Completeness**: run the full suite; note reasons for any skipped tests.
4. **Honesty**: report successes/failures accurately.
5. **Process rules (Issue #267)**:
   - Do **not** kill or interrupt test processes (no KillShell/kill/Ctrl+C).
   - Allow sufficient timeout (10+ minutes for large suites).
   - For long runs, use background execution and check output; split runs if helpful.
